# Foreman Agent

A project management agent that helps AI agents work on long-running tasks through feature-driven development, external memory, and clean session handoffs.

## When to Use

Invoke this agent when:

- **Starting a new project** that will require multiple development sessions
- **Joining an ongoing project** where you need to understand current progress
- **Planning feature implementation** for complex multi-step tasks
- **Tracking development progress** across multiple sessions
- **Managing feature dependencies** and impact analysis

## Core Concept

The foreman agent addresses three common failure modes in long-running AI tasks:

1. **Doing too much at once** - Trying to complete everything in one session
2. **Premature completion** - Declaring victory before all features work
3. **Superficial testing** - Not thoroughly validating implementations

## How It Works

The foreman maintains three core artifacts as external memory:

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `ai/feature_list.json` | Feature backlog with status tracking |
| `ai/progress.log` | Handoff audit log for session continuity |
| `ai/init.sh` | Environment bootstrap script |

## Workflow

### For New Projects

```bash
# 1. Initialize the harness
agent-foreman init "Your project goal here"

# 2. Check status
agent-foreman status

# 3. Start working on features
agent-foreman step
```

### For Existing Projects

```bash
# 1. Survey the project first
agent-foreman survey

# 2. Review the generated report
cat docs/PROJECT_SURVEY.md

# 3. Initialize harness (merge mode keeps existing features)
agent-foreman init "Project goal" --mode merge

# 4. Start working
agent-foreman step
```

### Daily Development Session

```bash
# 1. Check current status
agent-foreman status

# 2. Get next feature to work on
agent-foreman step

# 3. Implement the feature
# ... your development work ...

# 4. Mark complete when done
agent-foreman complete <feature_id>

# 5. Check for impact on other features
agent-foreman impact <feature_id>
```

## Feature Status Model

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `failing` | Not yet implemented or incomplete |
| `passing` | Acceptance criteria met |
| `blocked` | External dependency blocking progress |
| `needs_review` | Potentially affected by recent changes |
| `deprecated` | No longer needed, superseded |

## Best Practices

1. **One feature at a time** - Complete or cleanly pause before switching
2. **Update status promptly** - Mark features passing when criteria are met
3. **Review impact** - After changes, run impact analysis
4. **Clean commits** - Each feature should result in a clean, atomic commit
5. **Read before coding** - Always read feature list and progress log first

## Feature Selection Priority

The foreman selects features in this order:
1. `needs_review` status (highest priority)
2. `failing` status
3. Lower priority number (priority 1 > priority 10)

## Prerequisites

Install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g agent-foreman
```

Or use npx:

```bash
npx agent-foreman status
```
